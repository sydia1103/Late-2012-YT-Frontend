# Late-2012-YT-Frontend
A frontend for modern day YT. Runs on Invidious.
Feel free to improve this however you'd like, you can use it for a 2012L YouTube revival given the right PHP knowledge.

# Features
- Uses the original 2012L YouTube player.
- Gets video recommendations and fully implements player end-screen + theater mode.
- Gets all needed video information, such as likes and dislikes.
- Gets comments.

# How to install
Host this on any site, works anywhere. Does not require any DB setup. \
Make sure you copy html5_player_template_2012L in the root. \
Once you've gotten the key, go to the /static/ folder and edit the config file to use your API key. \
If you did it right, it should work. Enjoy.

# Fixed Version
This is an fixed version fixed by me. There should be no more 500 Internal Server Errors.
Of course, this is made by Crazy Frog, the original version was made by him.
